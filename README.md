## Description

This program generates a Sierpinski triangle by:
1. Starting with an equilateral triangle
2. Selecting random points within it
3. Repeatedly plotting points halfway between the current position and a randomly chosen vertex

The result is an emerging fractal pattern that becomes more detailed over time.

## Setup

1. Install [Processing](https://processing.org/download)
2. Create a new sketch and paste the provided code
3. Run the sketch

## Features

- Green dot shows current position
- Blue line shows selected vertex
- Red dot shows next position
- Black dots show the history of points
- Triangle outline shown in gray

## Controls

Just run the sketch and watch the pattern emerge! The animation runs automatically.
